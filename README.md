# Prediction-of-MBA-admissions

In this project, I have used an admissions dataset with multiple labels. 
The dataset has been initially been tested, cleaned and a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis has been perfoemed on the same. 
I have then selected the features and target variables which will be used in order to create a Machine Learning Model.
Finally, I have tested out various ML algorithms and tested the accuracy metrics to see which model has the best performance. 

(NOTE: While running the code, please download the dataset and copy paste the file path wherever the dataframe has been created by reading a csv/excel file)
